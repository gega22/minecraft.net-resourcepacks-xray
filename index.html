    <p class="title">XRay texture pack frequently asked questions and problems</p>
    <p class="black-text">Will server owners know that I am using this XRay?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">No. That being said, if you start mining a lot of ores and very little stone, they will get suspicious. There are many plugins that show all kinds of data based on how many blocks players mine and how much of each block they mine. You can find an xrayer who mines more ores than the average player very easily. If you deviate from the norm they will vanish teleport to you and check your cave pathing. When I used to run servers I had lots of people trying to circumvent this by acting as if they were strip mining and changing directions very conveniently to hit diamonds with their strip mines. But even if this doesn’t work, there are many plugins that will show how off the probability charts you are even if you try to not mine diamonds directly. It is next to impossible to make your mining seem random enough to not get caught. Your best bet is that the server owners don’t have any anti-xray plugins. But no, they can never tell what resource pack you are using unless you are playing on some custom-modded Minecraft client which hands servers this information.</p>
    <p class="black-text">With which Minecraft Editions is the XRay texture pack compatible?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">XRay is compatible with all Minecraft editions.</p>
    <p class="black-text">Is XRay for Minecraft free or do I have to pay for it?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">Of course, everything is free of charge.</p>
    <p class="black-text">How can I turn the pack on and off in the game?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">You have to go to the options and then to resource packs. There you can enable or disable it.</p>
    <p class="black-text">Can I use it with TLauncher?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">Yes, you can. The installation is exactly the same as for the official Java Edition. However, you should make sure that the launcher version and the pack version match.</p>
    <p class="black-text">Will it affect my FPS?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">No, because the ZIP archive and .mcpack only require little computing power. In addition, the included textures only have a resolution of 16×16. Just like in the default pack. You might even get a small FPS boost because your graphics card has to render much less.</p>
    <p class="black-text">How to fix the fake ores on servers with X-Ray Ultimate?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">The server is using an Anti Xray plugin which can alter block information sent to your device from the server. They decide what the world map you get looks like. Server devs add ores everywhere and you can’t see further than a few blocks under the ground. There is no way around this other than to hack their server and delete the anti-xray plugins. You could always try to get the world seed if it’s not a custom world and then work your way from there. But in all honesty, stop xraying on servers that don’t allow it.</p>
    <p class="black-text">What can I do if all blocks are dark and I can’t see anything?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">There is a quick solution to this problem because you just have to turn off the smooth lighting. For the Java Edition and MCPE this should be enough, but for the Windows 10 Edition, you should also use a night vision potion. You can use this potion in the other editions as well. Optionally you can also install the mod Optifine.</p>
    <p class="black-text">Why do I get an error message when I try to install XRay in Minecraft?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">It is an incompatibility message. It tells you that the pack is not compatible with your version of the game. However, this message is superfluous, because there will be no problem if you activate XRay anyway. Therefore, we advise you to simply ignore the error message.</p>
    <p class="black-text">Why don’t I see any dungeons in the XRay texture pack?</p>
    <p class="grey-text">You are probably confusing it with the XRay mod, which has these and many more features. As the title says, this is just a texture pack. As a result, only the blocks can be made transparent and no dungeons are highlighted.</p>
